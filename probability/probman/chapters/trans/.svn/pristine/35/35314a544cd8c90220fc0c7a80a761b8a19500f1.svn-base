\subsection{Uniform Random Numbers}
Let $U$ be a uniform random variable between 0 and 1.
\begin{problem}
Generate $10^6$ samples of $U$ using a C program and save into a file called uni.dat .
\end{problem}
%
\begin{problem}
Load the uni.dat file into python and plot the empirical CDF of $U$ using the samples in uni.dat.
\end{problem}
%
\begin{problem}
Verify that your CDF in the above problem is correct by plotting the theoretical $F_{U}(x)$.
\end{problem}
%
\subsection{Central Limit Theorem}
%
\begin{problem}
Generate $U_i, i = 1,2,\dots, 12$, a set of independent uniform random variables between 0 and 1 using a C program.
\end{problem}
%
\begin{problem}
Generate $10^6$ samples of the random variable
%
\begin{equation}
S = \sum_{i=1}^{12}U_i -6
\end{equation}
%
and save in a file called s.dat
\end{problem}
%
\begin{problem}
Load s.dat in python and plot the empirical PDF of $S$ using the samples in s.dat. Does it look familiar?  Comment.
\end{problem}
%
\subsection{From Uniform to Other}
%
\begin{problem}
Generate samples of 
%
\begin{equation}
V = -2\ln\brak{1-U}
\end{equation}
%
and plot its CDF.  Comment.
\end{problem}
%
\begin{problem}
Generate the Rayleigh distribution from Uniform. Verify your result through graphical plots.
